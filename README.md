#Notes:

About the project:

I just finished my E-Commerce Website project after putting in days of hard work. It was quite a new experience for me, and I ended up learning a lot.

In that project, I learned how to use multiple pages in React, using React Router and, I learned about Router Context, where I worked with local data.

While it didn't seem too tough at the time, I realized I needed to dive deeper into these concepts to grasp them fully. My plan now is to focus on understanding 
React and JavaScript theory better. It's time for some Pomodoro studying sessions and I cannot wait to start my next project!

About the design:

I had a great time configuring the design of this project. I took the time to design my banners my logo, and my images using Canva! 
Also, I spent some time choosing the appropriate colors. I decided to keep a minimal and clean style, hence the name I chose to use.
