#Notes:

Finally, after days of hard work, I was able to finish the E-Commerce Website.
This was a new experience for me and I learned so many new things.

In that project, I learned how to use multiple pages in React, using **React Router**
and, I learned about **Router Context**, where I worked with local data. 

Despite that at that time didn't seem that complicated, I feel that
I will need to study them more, so I can understand their function fully and try to use these new skills by myself.

So my next step after this big project is to immerse myself in some more React and Javascript theory!
